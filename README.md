# Sudoku Solver
 A python program to solve a sudoku puzzle

 This program goes cell by cell and for every empty value (denoted by 0's) it validates which integer would be suitable for that particular cell by checking if that value exists in the same row or column of that cell or in the same 3x3 box as the cell.

 If the given sudoku puzzle is solvable it will return the solved sudoku board or else it will print the exact same puzzle as it does not have an solution to calculate.
